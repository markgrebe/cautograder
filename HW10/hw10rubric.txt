For this homework, there is a different script, since this one had two source files and a header file, so I did a hardcoded script specifically for this one.  So add the grade book file to the HW010 directory, and then run from the HW010 directory the following:

python3 ../autograde_hw10.py

Late Assignment:
-------------
More than one hour late (after 1am 4/13 and
   before 12:59am 4/14)                         -5 points
After 1am on 4/14 and before 12:59 4/14         -12 points
After 1am on 4/15                               -50 points (zero)

As opposed to points off, I think I want to do additive points, so if they do the  part correct, they get the points for it:

Chess.h
    a)  5 points
    b)  5 points
    c)  2 points

Square.c:
    b) 15 points

Chess.c:
    b) 3 points
    c) 10 points
    d) 10 points

Based on last semester, 2/3 of them were easy, but the other 1/3 were hard to grade. Leave the hard ones you don't know for me again.  Last semster, someone had a hard path in the header name, so if you want to edit that and recompile, only take off 2 points for that.
