CS3500 Fall 2024 - HW 3 Rubric:
---------

* Each of 3 problems worth 20 points each/60 points total. On 
  firstname.c make sure that they use formatters to do the output
  not just printing fixed strings.

To run the autograder, drop the gradebook_*.zip from Blackboard in
the HW03 directory, and from that directory in the terminal shell, do:
 
python3 ../autograder.py
 
On the files not compiling, if there are errors in the *.compile for 
the problem,it is a zero for the problem as stated below.   However, 
if it failed to compile due to file name (for example toes.c vs Toes.c), 
then letâ€™s compile manually and run it, if itâ€™s good,
then we take 5 points off (Iâ€™m ratcheting that up each assignment).
 
Anything unknown, give me a list of students/problems and I can give instructions or grade it.
(Since I know students always get creative with errors ðŸ˜Š ). 
If you can put a draft grade in Blackboard for the problems they got correct, that would be great.

* firstname.c - This assignment should be all in 1 program. 
  and each part (a,b,c,d) should be printed on a seperate line, 
  so don't forget the newline charaacter.

* height.c - The program should prompt the user for the height, 
  then let user enter it, then prompt for the name, 
  and let user enter it.  Both the format specifiers for height 
  should be floats, as well as the variable to store it.

* download.c - The program should prompt the user for the download 
  speed, then let the user enter it, then prompt for the size of 
  the file, and let the user enter it.  All of the format specifiers 
  should be floats, as well as the variables to store them.
