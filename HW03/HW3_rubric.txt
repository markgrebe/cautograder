CS3500 Fall 2024 - HW 3 Rubric:
---------

* Each of 3 problems worth 20 points each/60 points total. On 
  firstname.c make sure that they use formatters to do the output
  not just printing fixed strings.

* firstname.c - This assignment should be all in 1 program. 
  and each part (a,b,c,d) should be printed on a seperate line, 
  so don't forget the newline charaacter.

* height.c - The program should prompt the user for the height, 
  then let user enter it, then prompt for the name, 
  and let user enter it.  Both the format specifiers for height 
  should be floats, as well as the variable to store it.

* download.c - The program should prompt the user for the download 
  speed, then let the user enter it, then prompt for the size of 
  the file, and let the user enter it.  All of the format specifiers 
  should be floats, as well as the variables to store them.
