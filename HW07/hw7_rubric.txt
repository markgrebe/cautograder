To run the autograder, drop the gradebook_*.zip from Blackboard in HW07 directory, and from that directory, do:
 
python3 ../autograder.py
 
On the files not compiling, if it failed to compile due to file name, then let’s compile manually and run it, if it’s good, then we take 10 points off.
If there are errors in the *.compile for the problem, it is a zero for the problem as we stated.   
 
Once again, anything unknown, give me a list of students/problems and I’ll handle it.   If you can put a draft grade in Blackboard for the problems they got correct, that would be great.
