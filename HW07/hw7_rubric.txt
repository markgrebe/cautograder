The autograder script has been updated to handle command line parameters for test cases, I think it's working well, but email me if you suspect there are issues.

I’ve added the HW07 directory, drop the gradebook_*.zip from Blackboard in there, and from that directory, do:
 
python3 ../autograder.py
 
On the files not compiling, if it failed to compile due to file name, then let’s compile manually and run it, if it’s good, then we take 5 points off.
If there are errors in the *.compile for the problem, it is a zero for the problem as we stated.   
 
Once again, anything unknown, give me a list of students/problems and I’ll handle it.   If you can put a draft grade in Blackboard for the problems they got correct, that would be great.
