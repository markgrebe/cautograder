CS3500 Fall 2024 - HW 2 Rubric:
---------

* Each of 3 problems worth 20 points each/60 points total.

To run the autograder, drop the gradebook_*.zip from Blackboard in the HW02 directory,
and from that directory in the terminal shell, do:
 
python3 ../autograder.py
 
On the files not compiling, if there are errors in the *.compile for the problem,
it is a zero for the problem as stated below.   However, if it failed to compile due to file name 
(for example toes.c vs Toes.c), then letâ€™s compile manually and run it, if itâ€™s good,
then we take 3 points off (Iâ€™m ratcheting that up each assignment).
 
Anything unknown, give me a list of students/problems and I can give instructions or grade it.
(Since I know students always get creative with errors ðŸ˜Š ). 
If you can put a draft grade in Blackboard for the problems they got correct, that would be great.

Any questions at all just ask.
