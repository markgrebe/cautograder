For this homework, there is a different script, since this one had two source files and a header file, so I did a hardcoded script specifically for this one.  So add the grade book file to the HW11 directory, and then run from the HW11 directory the following:

python3 ../autograde_hw11.py

On the files not compiling, if it failed to compile due to file name, then let’s compile manually and run it, if it’s good, then we take 5 points off.
If there are errors in the *.compile for the problem, it is a zero for the problem as we stated.   
 
Once again, anything unknown, give me a list of students/problems and I’ll handle it.   If you can put a draft grade in Blackboard for the problems they got correct, that would be great.

Test Case 1 - cond.output0 (FIRST is defined):
I print if FIRST is defined

Test Case 2 - cond.output1 (SECOND is defined):
I print if SECOND is defined

Test Case 3 - cond.output2 (FIRST and SECOND are defined):
I print if FIRST and SECOND are defined
